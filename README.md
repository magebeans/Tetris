Tetris
======

Tetris in C++, made for a school final CS project.
Controls show up on the menu screen.
A little slow, uses WinBGIM for graphics. Used CodeBlocks Educational, because it was the only IDE that supported WinBGIM.

ToDo:

Dissociate game logic from graphics, implement graphics separately, using SDL or OpenGL.
